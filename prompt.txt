Create a Simple Login System using Vite with React

Login Page:
Users enter username and password.
On successful login, a session token is stored in sessionStorage.
If the token is invalid or expired, redirect to the login page.
If a valid session exists, redirect from /login to /.

Dashboard Page:
After login, users are redirected to the dashboard (/).
The dashboard fetches user data asynchronously from a third-party API.
Includes loading states and error handling for data fetch.

Session Management:
Session token is used to check authentication.
If the token is expired or invalid, redirect to /login.
Logout clears the session token and redirects to /login.

Modular Components:
Sidebar, Header, and Footer are reusable and easily modifiable components.

Routes Configuration:
All routes are stored in a central config file (routes.ts).
/ is the dashboard (protected route), /login is the login page.

Environment Variables:
Static variables (API URLs) are stored in .env and accessed via import.meta.env.

API Handling:
All API requests are managed in separate files under api (e.g., auth.ts).
API functions (login, fetch user data, etc.) are imported and used in components.
